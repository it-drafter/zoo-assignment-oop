~~ An ordinary day in the zoo ~~

06:00 - botanists water the plants:
 Hi! I am Klaus, a zoo maintenance worker! BOTANIST to be precise.
 I water plants.

08:00 - the janitor opens the gates to the park:
 Hi! I am Sebastian, a zoo maintenance worker! JANITOR to be precise.
 I open and close the gates to the park.

09:00 - one of the animals breaks out of its cage:
 Ant on the loose! Catch me if you can! My speed is: 0.1km/h
 I have 6 legs.

11:00 - the break out was noticed:
 The Ant managed to make a 0.2km distance from the zoo.
 The guard Albert tranquilized the animal.
 The vet Timo made sure the animal was OK before it was put back in the cage.

 Animal keeper Hans was responsible for the breakout.

 Handyman Fritz repairs the cage.

16:00 - the janitor closes the gates and the day is over:
 Hi! I am Sebastian, a zoo maintenance worker! JANITOR to be precise.
 I open and close the gates to the park.
